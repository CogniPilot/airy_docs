CogniPilot is a new class of open source autopilot that can conduct safety critical missions such as transporting people, with a level of safety assurance not currently available in other open source autopilots. Minimum Viable Code for the Mission : By minimizing the lines of source code and branching, CogniPilot ensures higher reliability, maintainability, and verifiability of the project. Minimize Branch Statements in Control and Estimation Code : CogniPilot generally classifies its code components into two areas. The first is low-level driver and application code. The second is guidance, control, and estimation code for the vehicle. Developers carefully consider the addition of each branch (if statement etc.) in the code for the estimator and controller, as developers are modelling the entire system mathematically.

CogniPilot plans to limit official support for each release to a minimal amount of vehicles for each class, while providing out of tree support via templates. Deprecate if No-longer Maintained : On each release cycle, the CogniPilot technical steering committee (TSC) will make a decision on whether to maintain official support for each vehicle platform or whether to adopt a new platform.

About this guide These directions are written for someone with experience with embedded Linux and basic embedded computers. Step-by-step overview Download the pre-built latest image with Ubuntu 1 22.04 and ROS 2 3 Humble, exact instructions for that release image are included on the release documentation to use in conjunction with this guide. Extract the image navqplus-image-<version>.wic from the compressed downloaded file navqplus-image-<version>.wic.zstd and flash it to the EMMC , exact copy and paste instructions are on the release page. Log in for the first time by connecting to another computer using the USB to UART adatper , ethernet adapter or centermost (USB 2) USB-C\u00ae port . 2 Configure Wifi, System User Name and Password. Connect to NavQPlus over WiFi Install CogniPilot by running the included installer script. Flashing the eMMC To flash the eMMC on the NavQPlus use the uuu tool as part of the downloadable assests from the release. Once uuu has downloaded make sure to set it as executable: chmod a+x uuu find the boot switches on the NavQPlus and flip them to the \"Flash\" mode. Then, connect NavQPlus to the computer with the downloaded release using the leftmost (USB 1) USB-C\u00ae port and the two flash status lights should light up as shown in the image. Run the following command to make sure that the NavQPlus is recognized by uuu : ./uuu -lsusb If it shows that a device is connected, continue to flashing. To flash the board, use the general command below or copy and paste the specific command from the release: sudo ./uuu -b emmc_all navqplus-image-<version>.bin-flash_evk navqplus-image-<version>.wic Once this process has finished, make sure that the flash was successfull by comparing to the image below. If so, configure the boot switches to boot from eMMC. Boot Switches NavQPlus can be configured to boot from either SD card or eMMC. It also has a flash mode that allows for to flashing either the eMMC or SD card over USB-C\u00ae. See the table below for the boot switch configuration. Note we suggest to only flash and run from eMMC and leave the SD card for external storage. Mode Switch 1 Switch 2 SD ON ON eMMC OFF ON Flash ON OFF Log in for the first time Power on the NavQPlus by plugging in a USB-C\u00ae cable to the centermost (USB 2) USB-C\u00ae port or the 5 pin JST-GH power port if not powering over the centermost (USB 2) USB-C\u00ae port. NavQPlus will boot, and dispaly that it is fully booted with the status LEDs on board. The 3 LEDs by the USB1 port should be on, as well as two LEDs next to the CAN bus connectors. To log into NavQPlus, choose between using the included USB to UART adapter , Industrial Ethernet , or USB-C\u00ae with gadget ethernet mode . The default username/password combo is as follows: Username: user Password: user USB to UART adapter Connect the included USB to UART adapter to the UART2 port on the NavQPlus, and open a serial console application with a baud rate of 115200 8N1. Press enter if there is no output on the screen to get a log-in prompt. If using screen : screen /dev/ttyUSB<#> 115200 How to close cleanly out of screen . To exit screen cleanly when done press simultaneously Ctrl Shift A followed by typing k then y . Ethernet Connect the included IX Industrial Ethernet cable to NavQPlus, and connect the RJ45 connector to another computer, switch, or router on the local network. Log into NavQPlus over SSH. To SSH into NavQPlus, run the following command: ssh <username>@<hostname>.local Or depending on network setup: ssh <username>@<hostname> Changing hostname Default hostname is imx8mpnavq . The hostname can be changed and is suggested to be changed if running multiple NavQPlus on the same network. USB-C\u00ae Gadget Ethernet The IP address of the usb0 network interface on NavQPlus is statically assigned to 192.168.186.3. To use the USB-C\u00ae gadget ethernet to connect to the NavQPlus, assign a static IP on the connecting computers existing gadget ethernet interface. The network configuration is as follows: IP Address: 192.168.186.2 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0 Once USB-C\u00ae gadget ethernet interface is set up on the connected computer, SSH by running: ssh <username>@<hostname>.local Changing hostname Default hostname is imx8mpnavq . The hostname can be changed and is suggested to be changed if running multiple NavQPlus on the same network. Configuring WiFi, System Hostname, Username or Password Configuring WiFi on NavQPlus To connect NavQPlus to a WiFi network, use the nmcli command. The interface is relatively straightforward, to connect with nmcli , run the following command: sudo nmcli device wifi connect <network_name> password \"<password>\" If struggling to connect to a network, see if it is visible by running: sudo nmcli device wifi list Once connected to the WiFi network the NavQPlus will continue to connect to that network even after a reboot. What wifi network is the NavQPlus currently connected to? To see what Wifi network the NavQPlus is currently connected to run without sudo : nmcli device wifi list Or if running with sudo it will be the network preceeded with a star. OPTIONAL - Configuring System Hostname, Username or Password Optionally, to change the default hostname, username, or password, use the commands below. Change Hostname hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname> Change Username Danger Changing the username can be dangerous and possibly result in a broken system state requiring a re-flash. usermod -l <new_username> user mv /home/user /home/<new_username> Change Password passwd Connecting to NavQPlus over WiFi Once setup to connect over a local WiFi network, SSH into the NavQPlus over WiFi by running: ssh <username>@<hostname>.local Or depending on network setup: ssh <username>@<hostname> Changing hostname Default hostname is imx8mpnavq . The hostname can be changed and is suggested to be changed if running multiple NavQPlus on the same network. Install CogniPilot through included script Included in the image is an installation script that auto-updates when run. Before running make sure that the NavQPlus is connected to the internet on a network that allows it to download from github and Ubuntu servers. In the home directory there is a simple helper script that downloads and runs the latest CogniPilot NavQPlus installer . Cloning with ssh keys: If you want to use SSH keys with github on the NavQPlus you must first add or create them on the device. Otherwise you will need to answer n when asked to clone using already setup github ssh keys. Run the installer script: ./install_cognipilot.sh When prompted to choose whether or not to use ssh-keys: y to clone with ssh keys , best for development work but only select if ssh keys are already present and setup with GitHub. n to clone with https, best for users who do not plan to make modifications or develop. When prompted to choose whether or not to optimize runtime performance: It is reccomended to select y for runtime optimization when prompted. When prompted to choose a release: airy for a stable non-development release. main for active development. When prompted to choose a platform to build: b3rb is an ackermann based mobile robotic platform. elm4 is a differential drive based mobile robotic platform. Does CycloneDDS need configuring? The NavQPlus Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble image uses CycloneDDS by default. Make sure to edit the default CycloneDDSConfig.xml to only allow the networks that are desired to connector over when trying to get maximal performance. An example of this is using only the wifi device mlan0 to connect to a ROS 2 Domain. To save performance remove the other default included interfaces eth1 and usb0 by deleting those lines from the NavQPlus local ~/CycloneDDSconfig.xml .
